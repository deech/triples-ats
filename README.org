* Overview
This repo contains an implementation of [[https://github.com/atilaneves/pythagoras][Pythagorean triples benchmark.]]

* Installation
You don't need to have ATS to run the example, the ~build.sh~ script pulls
ATS and its dependencies directly from Github, builds the compiler from scratch
in ~./ATS/~ and compiles the implementations. Nothing outside this directory is
affected. All you need is ~git~, ~libgmp~ and standard ~C~ build tools, on
Debian based machines the following seems to suffice:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
apt-get install build-essential
#+END_EXAMPLE

If all goes well the executable ~triples~ should be in the current directory.

I have only built this repo on Linux, OSX may work, Windows probably will not.
